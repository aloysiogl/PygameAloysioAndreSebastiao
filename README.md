# Infinity Shooter

Infinity shooter is a fun and simple game made using Pygame. It was made as part of ITA's (Teachnological Institute of Aeronautics) discipline CES-22. The purpose of the game is to illustrate the use of POO in a real project as well as develop a simple structure for making easier the use of Pygame. This structure includes support for collisions, meshes, materials etc. The elements used are very similar to the elements used in the engine Unity.
