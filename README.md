# Infinity Shooter

Infinity shooter is a fun and simple game made using Pygame. It was made as part of ITA's (Teachnological Institute of Aeronautics) discipline CES-22. The purpose of the game is to illustrate the use of POO in a real project as well as develop a simple structure for making easier the use of Pygame. This structure includes support for collisions, meshes, materials etc. The elements used are very similar to the elements used in the engine Unity.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine if you use Linux. Instructions for Windows and Mac are similar.

### Prerequisites

You will just have to install Pygame. The instroctions below will show you how to do this for Linux (Unbuntu 16.04).

Furst install Python3 setup tools and pip:
