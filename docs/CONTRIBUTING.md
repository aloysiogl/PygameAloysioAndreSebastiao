## Contributing to frame

The frame is the base code wich really "runs the game". It could be understood as the game engine.
It is important to note that any changes to frame would directly impact the performance of the game. Because of this, pull requests to this part of the game may take longer to be aproved. To understand a little bit more about the
code in this section visit the wiki page about the [frame](https://github.com/aloysiogl/PygameAloysioAndreSebastiao/wiki/frame).

## Contributing to the structure

The structure is what describes the game as it is. this means that changes in this part just define the behavior of Infinity Shooter. As this behavior is not critic if the frame is being used
by other game pull requests are going to be accepted in a shor period of time. To understand a little bit more about the
code in this section visit the wiki page about the [structure](https://github.com/aloysiogl/PygameAloysioAndreSebastiao/wiki/structure).
